Exacting Frame is a container in the Arena.
Exacting Frame has a span called requirement.
The requirement of Exacting Frame is 2020mm.
Exacting Frame has a span called fulfillment.
The description of Exacting Frame is "It can accept exactly two sticks, as long as their combined lengths is exactly [requirement].  The current extent of everything in the Exacting Frame is [fulfillment]."

Check inserting a stick into the Exacting Frame:
	if the Exacting Frame contains two things, say "It already has two sticks in it -- no more will fit.  Yet..." instead;
	if the Rug of Solution is in the Arena, say "But you've already solved the puzzle!" instead.
	
Rug of Solution is a container.  Rug of Solution is nowhere.
An area is a kind of value. 10 sq mm specifies an area. A span times a span specifies an area.
Rug of Solution has an area called footage.  [The footage of the Rug is 1 sq mm.]
The description of the Rug of Solution is "There are two sticks on the Rug, at right angles -- they define an area of exactly [footage]."

A slot is a kind of container.
A slot has a span called length.
The description of a slot is "If there's something in here, it has a length of [length]."

The First Slot is a slot in the Rug of Solution.
The Second Slot is a slot in the Rug of Solution.

Carry out inserting a stick (called st) into a slot (called sl):
	now the length of sl is the length of st;
	say "Okay...";
	continue the action.

Carry out examining the Rug:
	now the footage of the rug is the length of the First Slot times the length of the Second Slot;
	continue the action.
	
Carry out inserting a stick into the Exacting Frame:
	now the fulfillment of the Exacting Frame is the fulfillment of the Exacting Frame plus the length of the noun;
	if the fulfillment of the Exacting Frame is the requirement of the Exacting Frame:
		now the Rug of Solution is in the Arena;
		say "*** The two sticks fit perfectly!  A rug appears... you should take the two sticks, put them in the slots, and then examine the rug. ***";		
		now the box of rods is closed;
		now the box of rods is locked;
		[now the player carries every thing in the Exacting Frame;]
		stop the action;
	continue the action.
	
Carry out taking a stick which is in the Exacting Frame:
	if the Rug of Solution is in the Arena, continue the action;
	if the Exacting Frame contains two things:
		say "Well that didn't work.  You take out the stick and put it into the Bag of Sticks, so that you'll know you've already tried this combination.";
		now the noun is in the Bag of Rods;
		now the fulfillment of the Exacting Frame is the fulfillment of the Exacting Frame minus the length of the noun;		
		if the Box of Rods contains nothing:
			say "Well, you've exhausted all these combinations.  Time to retire the stick in the frame, reset, and move on...";
			if the Exacting Frame contains a stick:
				let s be a random stick in the Exacting Frame;
				now s is in the Sack of Rods;
				now the fulfillment of the Exacting Frame is 0mm;
			repeat with st running through sticks in the Bag of Rods:
				now st is in the Box of Rods;
	stop the action.


Instead of taking a stick which is in the Box of Rods when the player carries a stick, say "Slow down there, Tex."


test me with "n / take stick from box / s / put stick in frame / n / take stick from box / s /  put stick in frame / x frame / take stick from frame / l / i"
